# Requirements
## Introduction
* Smoke detector is a device that senses smoke, typically as an indication of fire.
* Commercial security devices issue a signal to a fire alarm control panel as a part of a fire alarm system, while household smoke detectors, also known as
smoke alarms, generally issue a local audible or visual alarm from the detector itself or several detectors if there are multiple smoke detectors interlinked. 
* Smoke can be detected either optically (photoelectric) or by physical process (ionization): detectors may use either, or both, methods.
* Domestic smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units, to several interlinked mains-powered units with battery backup; with these interlinked units,
if any unit detects smoke, all trigger even if household power has gone out.
